# TODO: Rewrite Portfolio Website with Bootstrap

- [x] Update index.html: Add Bootstrap CSS and JS CDN links, rewrite HTML structure using Bootstrap classes (navbar, container, row/col, card, badge, btn, etc.)
- [x] Minimize styles.css: Remove most custom styles, retain only essential overrides for dark theme
- [x] Keep script.js unchanged (navbar active link functionality remains compatible)
- [x] Test the site by opening index.html in browser to verify Bootstrap integration, responsiveness, and appearance
